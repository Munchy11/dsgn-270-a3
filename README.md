## Design-270-A3
This is my other design concept, i am going for the campground or outdoors logo look. I added trees and mountains to background to make the visual hierarchy much more appealing. The colours were chosen to make the concept of the design pop out rather than be simple as most logos i had seen online were very, neutral looking and blended together. The light blue ring around the background circle symbolizes a river going around the wilderness. I ended up unionizing some of my pieces of art like the mountains, so it made it much easier to run the code. I challenged myself to do this logo as it had much more paths than my first one, and i now know it is important to have your code clean to stay on the right track.
